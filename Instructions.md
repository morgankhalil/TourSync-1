# Project Analysis & Fix Plan

## Current State Assessment

### Core Issues
1. Many unfinished/non-working components
2. Duplicate code (e.g. multiple Sidebar implementations)
3. Inconsistent routing structure
4. Missing key functionality in many components

### Working Components
- Basic routing setup in App.tsx
- Core layout components (AppLayout, Header)
- Basic venue and tour data fetching
- API routes for core CRUD operations

### Non-Working/Incomplete Components
1. Artist Discovery features
2. Tour Planning Wizard
3. Venue Calendar functionality 
4. Bandsintown integration
5. Map integrations
6. Mobile navigation

## Fix Priority Order

### 1. Core Infrastructure (Immediate)
- Consolidate duplicate components
- Fix routing structure
- Standardize layout components
- Remove unused components

### 2. Essential Features (High Priority) 
- Tour Management
- Venue Calendar
- Basic Artist Discovery
- Map Integration

### 3. Enhancement Features (Secondary)
- Advanced Discovery
- Tour Optimization
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Analytics

## Specific Action Items

1. **Component Cleanup**
   - Delete `/components/Sidebar.tsx` (duplicate)
   - Consolidate navigation components
   - Remove incomplete feature pages

2. **Route Restructure**
   - Implement proper nested routing
   - Add route guards for unfinished features
   - Create consistent navigation hierarchy

3. **Feature Completion**
   - Focus on core tour management first
   - Complete venue calendar integration
   - Implement basic artist discovery
   - Add Google Maps integration

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add basic test coverage
   - Validate all API endpoints
   - Test core user flows

## Next Steps

1. Begin with component cleanup
2. Fix routing structure
3. Complete core features
4. Add proper error handling
5. Implement proper state management
6. Add comprehensive testing

This structured approach will help bring order to the codebase and make it more maintainable.
